* Never remove or modify existing comments in code.
* Preserve all inline comments, docstrings, and TODOs verbatim.
* When editing, highlight only the specific lines to change without touching comments.
* Each time I ask you to add a Marimo cell, add a comprehensive comment in Spanish above the cell explaining what it does and what it depends on.
